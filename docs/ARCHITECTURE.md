# Architecture

## Direction
The game is a 3D platformer with a side/platform-style presentation. The player moves in a constrained gameplay plane/track while the world may use full 3D geometry. Camera behavior belongs to gameplay, while camera/input/window implementation details stay behind engine/backend boundaries.

## Dependency direction
`gameplay -> core abstractions`
`ui -> core/gameplay public state`
`render backend -> raylib initially`
`physics backend -> Jolt when introduced`
`platform backend -> OS/raylib platform services`

Gameplay must not depend on backend implementation headers.

## Early abstraction points
Only abstract boundaries that are known to vary by target:
- application/platform lifecycle;
- input device mapping to semantic actions;
- filesystem/save location;
- timing;
- graphics/window backend exposure;
- physics integration boundary;
- asset location/loading.

Do not build a general-purpose engine before the game needs it.
