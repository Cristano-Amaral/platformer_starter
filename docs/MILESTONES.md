# Milestones

## Milestone 00 — Repository/Foundation Setup
Goal: create a clean Cursor/CMake repository before gameplay implementation.

Acceptance criteria:
- Repository structure exists.
- `AGENTS.md`, Cursor Rules, and project Skills exist and are discoverable.
- CMake config has Debug, Development, and Release conventions.
- A minimal executable target exists.
- Windows Development build can be configured with Visual Studio 2022.
- No gameplay feature is implemented yet.

## Milestone 01 — Window and Game Loop [ACTIVE]

### Goal

Integrate raylib and establish the minimum runtime foundation of the game.

The application must open a graphical window, run a game loop and shut down cleanly.

No gameplay must be implemented in this milestone.

### Requirements

- Integrate raylib through CMake.
- Use a pinned raylib version. Never depend on a floating `master` branch.
- Keep CMake as the canonical build system.
- Windows remains the only active target for now.
- Create a minimal application lifecycle:
  - Initialize
  - Run
  - Shutdown
- Open a resizable 1280x720 window.
- Window title: `Platformer3D`.
- Render a solid background every frame.
- Close cleanly using the window close button.
- ESC may also close the application.
- Keep raylib-specific code behind the platform/render boundary.
- `Main.cpp` must not contain the game loop implementation.
- Gameplay code must not include raylib headers.

### Suggested structure

game/source/
  Main.cpp
  core/
    Application.h
    Application.cpp
  platform/
    Window.h
    Window.cpp

The exact implementation may vary if a simpler architecture satisfies the same constraints.

### Out of scope

Do NOT implement:

- player
- input abstraction beyond what is required to close the application
- physics
- Jolt
- GLM integration
- Dear ImGui
- camera
- level
- assets
- Asset Cooker
- menus
- audio
- shadows
- post-processing

### Acceptance criteria

1. `cmake --preset windows-vs2022` succeeds.
2. `cmake --build --preset windows-development` succeeds.
3. Running the Development executable opens a 1280x720 graphical window.
4. The window remains open while the game loop runs.
5. The window can be resized.
6. Closing the window exits without errors.
7. No gameplay exists yet.
8. raylib-specific calls are isolated from future gameplay code.
9. CMake continues to be the source of truth for the build.

## Milestone 02 — Platformer Prototype
- Greybox player represented by primitive geometry.
- Left/right movement, jump, gravity, floor collision.
- Platform-style camera with 3D perspective/orthographic decision documented after testing.
- Input is expressed as semantic actions, not raw keys in gameplay.

## Milestone 03 — Level Greybox
- Platforms, hazards, spawn, checkpoint, goal.
- Reset/death loop.
- First simple test level loaded from data rather than hard-coded placement where practical.

## Milestone 04 — Physics Integration
- Introduce Jolt only if the prototype shows it is justified.
- Preserve gameplay-facing collision/movement abstraction.

## Milestone 05 — Menus + Debug Tools
- Main menu, pause menu, Development-only diagnostics.
- Basic frame-time/FPS display.

## Milestone 06 — Asset Pipeline
- Python environment and cooker skeleton.
- Source/cooked asset separation.
- Incremental cooking foundation.

## Later milestones
Animation, enemies, collectibles, level editor, audio, save system, profiling/optimization, Raspberry Pi validation, Android port, iOS feasibility/backend work.
